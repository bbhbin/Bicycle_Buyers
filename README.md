# Bicycle_Buyers
Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Course
As someone who recently purchased a bike, I was really interested in looking at data regarding bike purchases. I wanted to see the demographics of people buying bikes and what kind of variables different bike purchasers have.
With this goal in mind, I looked for a bike shop's dataset but was not able to find public ones readily available. Since public purchase information regarding bicycles are not readily available, I went through Kaggle to find a dataset that can best represent what a customer/potential customer profile list would look like.

In this case study I have made up a company called “Madeup Bicycles.” Logo and theme is provided in the PDF(viewable) & PPTX(downloadable) files.
